## [3.8.3] - 2025-11-02

### 🚨 Critical Fix - Account Block Detection System

Added intelligent detection system that stops infinite reconnection loops when Facebook blocks an account.

### Fixed

- **Infinite Reconnection Loop When Account Blocked**: Bot now intelligently detects when Facebook has logged out the account
  - Stops all reconnection attempts after 3 consecutive "Not logged in" errors
  - Provides clear, actionable error message explaining what happened
  - Prevents log spam from hundreds of failed reconnection attempts
  - Cleans up all timers and connections properly when account is blocked

### Added

- **Smart Account Block Detection** (`listenMqtt.js`):
  - New `isAccountBlocked()` function detects Facebook logout/block errors
  - New `handleAccountBlockDetection()` manages block state and cleanup
  - Tracks consecutive failures to distinguish temporary errors from permanent blocks
  - After 3 consecutive "Not logged in" errors, displays helpful error message
  - Automatically stops MQTT client, presence updates, and health checks
  - Sets `ctx.loggedIn = false` to prevent further attempts

- **Clear User Guidance When Blocked**:
  ```
  🚨 ACCOUNT BLOCKED BY FACEBOOK 🚨
  Your Facebook account has been logged out by Facebook's security system.
  
  This happens when:
    • Facebook detects automated/bot activity
    • The account was logged in from a suspicious location
    • Too many rapid actions were performed
    • The appstate.json is expired or invalid
  
  TO FIX THIS:
    1. Generate a NEW appstate.json from a fresh browser session
    2. Use a DIFFERENT Facebook account (this one may be flagged)
    3. Login to Facebook in a browser first to verify the account
    4. Wait 24-48 hours before trying again with this account
  ```

### Changed

- **getSeqID()**: Now checks block status before attempting to fetch sequence ID
- **reconnectMqtt()**: Skips reconnection if account is blocked
- **MQTT 'close' event**: Checks block status before scheduling reconnection
- All reconnection logic now respects the account block state

### Impact

✅ **Stops infinite reconnection loops**
✅ **Clear, actionable error messages**
✅ **Cleaner logs when account is blocked**
✅ **Proper cleanup of resources**
✅ **Easier to diagnose and fix issues**

### Important Notes

**If you see the "ACCOUNT BLOCKED" message:**
1. Your current appstate.json is NO LONGER VALID
2. You MUST generate a new appstate.json from a fresh browser login
3. Consider using a different Facebook account if this one is flagged
4. The bot has stopped trying to reconnect to prevent further detection

## [3.8.2] - 2025-11-02

### 🛡️ Critical Anti-Detection Improvements

This release significantly reduces Facebook's ability to detect and block bot accounts by making bot behavior patterns much more human-like and unpredictable.

### Fixed

- **Facebook Account Blocks/Logouts**: Major anti-detection overhaul
  - Reduced MQTT keep-alive interval: 30s → **60s** (less aggressive, more human-like)
  - Reduced cookie refresh frequency: Every 20 min → **Every 30 minutes** (less predictable)
  - Reduced MQTT ping frequency: Every 30s → **Every 2 minutes** (more realistic)
  - Increased presence update interval: 25s → **3 minutes** (matches real human behavior)
  - Increased idle detection timeout: 3 min → **8 minutes** (less paranoid reconnections)
  - Increased health check interval: 30s → **2-3 minutes** (randomized, less obvious)
  - Increased reconnection tolerance: 3 failures → **10 failures** (avoids spam reconnections)

### Changed

- **Randomized Timing Patterns** (Critical for stealth):
  - Cookie refresh now uses randomized intervals (+0-5 minutes jitter)
  - MQTT pings use randomized intervals (+0-1 minute jitter)
  - Health checks use randomized intervals (+0-1 minute jitter)
  - Initial delays randomized: 1-3 minutes for cookie refresh, 30-60s for MQTT ping
  - All timings avoid fixed patterns that Facebook can detect

- **Reduced Logging Verbosity**:
  - MQTT ping success logs: Every 10 pings → **Every 20 pings**
  - MQTT ping failure logs: Every 3 failures → **Every 5 failures**
  - Cookie refresh failure logs: Every failure → **Every 3 failures**
  - Reduces log spam and computational overhead

- **Smarter Reconnection Logic**:
  - Less aggressive: Reconnects after 10 failures instead of 3-5
  - More patient: Waits 5 seconds between reconnection attempts (was 3s)
  - Less paranoid: Tolerates 10 minutes of inactivity before forcing reconnection (was 3 min)
  - Avoids creating suspicious rapid reconnection patterns

### Technical Details

**MQTT Configuration Changes** (`listenMqtt.js`):
```javascript
// Before (Too Aggressive - Detectable)
KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL: 30,           // Every 30 seconds
PRESENCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL: 25000,  // Every 25 seconds
IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL: 30000,       // Check every 30s
MAX_IDLE_TIME: 180000,            // Force reconnect after 3min

// After (Human-like - Stealthy)
KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL: 60,           // Every 60 seconds
PRESENCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL: 180000, // Every 3 minutes
IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL: 120000,      // Check every 2min
MAX_IDLE_TIME: 480000,            // Force reconnect after 8min
```

**Cookie Refresh Changes** (`client.js`):
```javascript
// Before (Too Frequent - Detectable)
refreshInterval: 1200000,  // 20 minutes, fixed timing
mqttPingInterval: 30000,   // 30 seconds, fixed timing

// After (Human-like - Stealthy)
refreshInterval: 1800000,  // 30 minutes base + 0-5min jitter
mqttPingInterval: 120000,  // 2 minutes base + 0-1min jitter
```

### Impact

✅ **Significantly reduced risk of Facebook account blocks**
✅ **More human-like behavior patterns**
✅ **Maintains bot reliability and responsiveness**
✅ **Lower CPU and network usage**
✅ **Less log spam**

### Migration Notes

- Existing bots will automatically use the new timings on restart
- No configuration changes required
- Cookie refresh and MQTT pings will be less frequent but more stealthy
- Bots will still respond quickly to messages (no delay in message handling)

---

## [3.8.1] - 2025-11-02

### Fixed

- **Bot Not Responding After Wrong Command**: Critical fix for command processing
  - Added robust error handling wrapper around user callback in MQTT listener
  - Prevents synchronous errors in message handler from breaking subsequent message processing
  - Ensures bot continues responding even if a command execution fails
  - Added safety try-catch wrapper to protect global callback execution
  - Errors in message handler are now properly caught and logged without breaking the listener
  - Users typing wrong commands followed by correct commands will now get responses

### Changed

- **Enhanced MQTT Listener Error Resilience** (`listenMqtt.js`):
  - Wrapped user callback in try-catch to prevent handler exceptions from breaking message flow
  - Errors in callback are logged but don't stop MQTT message processing
  - Maintains connection stability even with buggy command handlers

---

## [3.8.0] - 2025-11-01

### 🚀 Major Enhancement - Ultra-Reliable MQTT Connection System

Completely reworked MQTT keep-alive and health monitoring to eliminate 5-minute timeout issues and ensure 24/7 bot responsiveness.

### Fixed

- **Bot Not Responding After 5 Minutes of Inactivity**: Complete solution
  - Reduced MQTT keep-alive interval: 60s → **30s** (more aggressive)
  - Reduced presence update interval: 50s → **25s** (twice as frequent)
  - Added dedicated idle connection detector running every **30 seconds**
  - Auto-reconnect triggers after **3 minutes** of no MQTT messages (was 5 min)
  - Connection testing with QoS 1 to ensure delivery and detect dead connections
  - Three-layer protection: Cookie refresh (30s) + Presence (25s) + Idle detector (30s)

- **Stale MQTT Connections Not Detected**: New proactive testing
  - Detects when MQTT appears "connected" but is actually dead
  - Sends test message with QoS 1 to verify responsiveness
  - Forces reconnection if test fails or times out
  - Logs connection test results for debugging

- **MQTT Ping Failures Too Tolerant**: More aggressive reconnection
  - Reconnects after **3** ping failures (was 5)
  - Reconnects after **5** total failures (was 10)
  - Added 5-second timeout to each ping to detect hung connections
  - Uses QoS 1 for pings to guarantee delivery confirmation

- **Health Monitoring Too Slow**: Faster detection and recovery
  - Health checks now run every **30 seconds** (was 60s)
  - Idle timeout reduced to **3 minutes** (was 5 min)
  - Checks for both ping failures AND message inactivity
  - Multiple independent systems monitoring connection health

### Added

- **Enhanced MQTT Keep-Alive System** (`listenMqtt.js`):
  ```javascript
  MQTT_CONFIG = {
    KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL: 30,           // 30s (was 60s)
    PRESENCE_UPDATE_INTERVAL: 25000,  // 25s (was 50s)
    IDLE_CHECK_INTERVAL: 30000,       // NEW: Check every 30s
    MAX_IDLE_TIME: 180000,            // NEW: Max 3min idle
  }
  ```
  - New idle connection detector with automatic testing
  - Connection test using QoS 1 to verify responsiveness
  - Forced reconnection if connection test fails
  - Independent timer for idle detection

- **Improved Cookie Refresh Manager** (`client.js`):
  - Faster health monitoring: 30-second intervals (was 60s)
  - Earlier reconnection: 3-minute threshold (was 5 min)
  - More aggressive ping failure handling: 3 failures trigger reconnect
  - 5-second timeout for MQTT pings to detect hung connections
  - Better QoS 1 usage for guaranteed delivery confirmation

- **Enhanced startOnlinePresence** (`startOnlinePresence.js`):
  - Now includes MQTT keep-alive pings every **20 seconds**
  - Dual-layer approach: HTTP activity simulation + MQTT pings
  - Independent timers for HTTP and MQTT (both run separately)
  - Better error handling for connection issues
  - Gracefully handles MQTT client unavailability
  - Credits updated to reflect enhancements

### Changed

- **MQTT Configuration Timings**: Optimized for reliability
  | Setting | Before | After | Impact |
  |---------|--------|-------|--------|
  | Keep-Alive | 60s | **30s** | 2x faster detection |
  | Presence | 50s | **25s** | 2x more frequent |
  | Health Check | 60s | **30s** | 2x faster monitoring |
  | Idle Timeout | 5min | **3min** | Earlier recovery |
  | Ping Failures | 10 | **5** | Faster reconnection |
  | QoS Level | 0 | **1** | Guaranteed delivery |

- **Multi-Layer Protection System**: Three independent systems
  1. **Cookie Refresh Manager**: MQTT pings every 30s with 5s timeout
  2. **Core MQTT System**: Presence updates every 25s + idle detector every 30s
  3. **startOnlinePresence**: Additional MQTT pings every 20s (when enabled)

- **Connection Testing**: Proactive health verification
  - Tests connection after 3 minutes of inactivity
  - Uses QoS 1 to require acknowledgment
  - Forces reconnection if test fails
  - Logs test results for visibility

### Technical Details

**How the Multi-Layer System Works:**
1. **Every 20 seconds**: startOnlinePresence sends MQTT presence (if enabled)
2. **Every 25 seconds**: Core MQTT sends presence update
3. **Every 30 seconds**: Cookie refresh manager sends keep-alive ping with timeout
4. **Every 30 seconds**: Idle detector checks for stale connections
5. **After 3 minutes idle**: Automatic connection test and recovery

**Connection State Detection:**
- Tracks `ctx.lastMessageTime` for all incoming MQTT messages
- Calculates idle time in real-time
- Tests connection before forcing reconnection
- Logs all connection state changes

**Failure Recovery:**
- 3 consecutive ping failures → Reconnect
- Connection test fails → Reconnect
- 5 total ping failures → Reconnect
- 3+ minutes of no messages → Test and reconnect if needed

**Benefits:**
- ✅ No more 5-minute timeout issues
- ✅ Faster recovery: 30s detection + immediate reconnection
- ✅ Triple-layered protection prevents any single point of failure
- ✅ Proactive detection before messages fail
- ✅ Self-healing with automatic reconnection

### Breaking Changes

None. All changes are backward compatible.

## [3.7.9] - 2025-11-01

### 🐛 Critical Fix - MQTT Cleanup on Logout/Remove

Fixed MQTT connections persisting after bot logout or deletion, preventing response issues.

### Fixed

- **MQTT Persists After Logout**: Complete MQTT disconnect before logout
  - Disables `autoReconnect` BEFORE disconnecting MQTT
  - Removes all MQTT event listeners to prevent reconnection attempts
  - Waits 500ms for pending operations, then disconnects MQTT
  - Waits additional 1000ms for complete disconnection
  - Clears `ctx.reconnectMqtt` function reference
  
- **MQTT Reconnection During Logout**: Added logout state checks
  - MQTT 'close' event now checks `ctx.loggedIn` status
  - Only attempts reconnection if bot is still logged in
  - Double-checks login state before triggering reconnection
  - Logs reason when reconnection is cancelled

- **Jubiar Bot Removal**: Proper async logout handling
  - Changed `tempApi.logout()` to `await tempApi.logout()`
  - Logs waiting message during MQTT cleanup
  - Made `stopAll()` async to properly wait for all logouts
  - Updated SIGINT handler to await `stopAll()`

### Added

- **Step-by-Step Logout Logging**: Clear visibility into logout process
  - `🔴 Initiating logout sequence...`
  - `Step 1: Cleaning up resources...`
  - `Step 2: Logging out from Facebook...`
  - `✅ Logout completed successfully.`

- **Enhanced Resource Cleanup Order**:
  1. Disable autoReconnect
  2. Stop cookie refresh manager (stops pings & health checks)
  3. Clear presence intervals
  4. Wait 500ms for pending operations
  5. Remove MQTT event listeners
  6. Force disconnect MQTT
  7. Clear reconnect function
  8. Wait 1000ms for complete cleanup
  9. Proceed with logout

### Changed

- **Logout Flow**: Now fully async with proper timing
  - Cleanup → Wait → Disconnect → Wait → Logout
  - Prevents race conditions with reconnection logic
  
- **MQTT Close Handler**: Smarter reconnection logic
  - Checks if `ctx.loggedIn !== false` before reconnecting
  - Logs cancellation reason for better debugging
  - "Reconnection disabled or bot logged out."

### Technical Details

- Total cleanup time: ~1.5 seconds (500ms + 1000ms waits)
- MQTT event listeners cleared via `removeAllListeners()`
- Reconnection timeout cancelled by logout state check
- Jubiar `stopAll()` uses `Promise.all()` for parallel logout

  - Bypasses global logging settings to always show presence activity
  - Prefixed all logs with `[PRESENCE]` for easy filtering
  - Works even when `logLevel: 'silent'` is set
  - Shows startup, activity, and shutdown messages

- **Bot Not Responding After 3-5 Minutes**: Added health monitoring system
  - Tracks `ctx.lastMessageTime` and `ctx.messageCount` for all MQTT messages
  - Health check runs every 60 seconds
  - Automatically forces reconnection if no MQTT activity for 5+ minutes
  - Detects silent connection drops that appear "connected" but receive no messages

### Added

- **Connection Health Monitoring**: New `checkConnectionHealth()` method
  - Monitors time since last MQTT message
  - Triggers forced reconnection when bot becomes unresponsive
  - Runs independently from ping failures
  - Logs warning before reconnecting

- **Message Activity Tracking**: 
  - `ctx.lastMessageTime`: Timestamp of last received message
  - `ctx.messageCount`: Total messages received
  - Updates on every MQTT message (typing, messages, presence, etc.)

### Changed

- **Health Check Timer**: Added to `CookieRefreshManager.startMqttKeepAlive()`
  - Runs every minute alongside MQTT pings
  - Properly cleaned up in `stop()` method
- **Presence Logs**: All now use `console.log/error` with [PRESENCE] prefix
  - `🟢 Starting continuous online presence simulation...`
  - `Activity: <url>`
  - `✓ Human activity simulation completed`
  - `🔴 Online presence stopped`

### Technical Details

- Health monitoring triggers after 5 minutes of inactivity
- Complements existing ping failure detection (5 failures = reconnect)
- Two-layer protection: ping failures OR message timeout
- Health check timer properly cleared on manager stop

- Ping failures accumulate and trigger manual reconnection
- Logout now uses multi-strategy approach for higher success rate

---

## [3.7.6] - 2025-11-01

### 🐛 Critical Fixes - Bot Responsiveness & Restart Function

Fixed two critical bugs affecting bot performance and reliability.

### Fixed

- **Bot Sleeping/Unresponsive Issue**: Removed all sleep functionality from antiDetection.js
  - Completely removed sleepHours, peakHours, slowHours, weekendSlower features
  - ActivityScheduler now always allows responses (no time restrictions)
  - Bot responds immediately to user messages without delays
  - Changed from blocking await to non-blocking promise handling in online presence

- **Double Response Bug on Restart**: Fixed duplicate message handlers after bot restart
  - Force stops old listeners before removing bot
  - Force stops online presence before removing bot
  - Increased cleanup delay from 500ms to 1500ms for complete teardown
  - Prevents duplicate message handlers from persisting

### Changed

- **Online Presence**: Simplified to only send presence updates without activity simulation
- **Restart Function**: Enhanced cleanup process with forced listener and presence shutdown
- **Promise Handling**: Changed from synchronous await to asynchronous .then/.catch for non-blocking execution
- **ActivityScheduler**: Completely stripped down to no-op class (always returns true/1.0/false)

### Technical Details

- Removed simulateHumanActivity function that caused blocking delays
- Online presence now only calls simulateOnlineUser without delays
- Restart function explicitly calls stopListening() and onlinePresence.stop() before removal
- Extended wait time between removal and re-adding bot for proper cleanup
- ActivityScheduler methods now return safe defaults without any logic

---

## [3.7.5] - 2025-11-01

### 🐛 Critical Fix - Continuous Online Presence

Fixed major bug where online presence simulation only ran once instead of continuously.

### Fixed

- **One-Time Execution Bug**: Online presence now runs continuously every 30 seconds instead of stopping after first run
- **Interval System**: Implemented proper setInterval for continuous presence checks
- **Session Persistence**: Maintains active session throughout the bot's lifetime

### Changed

- **Behavior**: Changed from "run once for duration" to "run continuously every interval"
- **Default Interval**: Set to 30 seconds (30000ms) for frequent online status updates
- **Logging**: Updated to show "continuous" simulation with interval time instead of duration

### Technical Details

- Uses `setInterval` to repeatedly check online status every 30 seconds
- Initializes session once and reuses it for all presence checks
- Proper cleanup with `stop()` method to clear intervals
- Runs initial presence check immediately, then every 30 seconds thereafter

### Usage

```javascript
const presence = api.startOnlinePresence(30000);
```

The bot will now maintain online status continuously every 30 seconds until stopped.

## [3.7.4] - 2025-11-01

### 🔧 Bug Fixes & Improvements - Online Presence

Minor update to improve the online presence simulation feature with better error handling and timing adjustments.

### Fixed

- **Cookie Jar Handling**: Improved cookie retrieval from jar with multiple fallback methods
- **Timing Issue**: Added 3-second delay before initializing online presence to ensure cookies are ready
- **Better Cookie Access**: Enhanced support for different cookie jar implementations including direct store access
- **Error Logging**: Changed from throwing errors to graceful warnings when cookies aren't ready

### Changed

- **Default Duration**: Changed from 20 minutes to 10 minutes for more frequent presence updates
- **User Agent**: Updated to standard Windows Chrome user agent for better compatibility
- **Session Validation**: Now validates cookie availability before attempting to create session

### Technical Improvements

- Accesses cookie jar store directly if standard methods fail
- Supports both `getCookiesSync` and `getCookies` methods
- Handles cookie objects with both `key/value` and `toString()` formats
- Returns null gracefully instead of throwing errors when cookies unavailable
- Deferred initialization ensures cookies are fully loaded before session creation

- **New API Method**: `api.startOnlinePresence(duration)`
  - Simulates human-like browsing activity on Facebook
  - Randomly visits different Facebook pages (feed, messages, notifications, groups, watch, marketplace)
  - Adds realistic timing delays between actions (3-10 seconds)
  - Periodically sends online status updates to maintain active presence
  - Includes random "swiping" actions for added realism
  - Configurable duration (default: 20 minutes / 1200000ms)
  - Returns control object with `stop()` method for manual termination

### Features

- **Human Activity Simulation**
  - Visits 2-5 random Facebook pages per cycle
  - Variable delays between actions (3-10 seconds)
  - 30% chance of performing additional "swipe" action
  - Activity cycles every 60-150 seconds

- **Online Status Management**
  - Sends online presence updates every 5-10 minutes
  - Integrates with Facebook's active endpoint
  - Maintains consistent online indicator

- **Smart Session Management**
  - Uses existing cookie jar for authentication
  - Automatic cookie handling with axios-cookiejar-support
  - Realistic browser headers for anti-detection

### Usage

```javascript
const { login } = require('biar-fca');

login({ appState }, (err, api) => {
    if (err) return console.error(err);
    
    const presence = api.startOnlinePresence(20 * 60 * 1000);
    
    console.log('Online presence started for 20 minutes');
    
    setTimeout(() => {
        presence.stop();
        console.log('Online presence stopped');
    }, 20 * 60 * 1000);
});
```

### Technical Details

- Integrates seamlessly with existing cookie session
- Uses axios with cookie jar support for HTTP requests
- Randomized action selection prevents detection patterns
- Configurable duration with auto-stop capability

## [3.7.1] - 2025-11-01

### 🐛 Bug Fix - sendTypingIndicator

This release fixes a critical error in the `sendTypingIndicator` function that caused crashes when called with flexible parameters.

### Fixed

- **Critical**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'toString')` in sendTypingIndicator
  - Root cause: Function expected parameters in strict order `(sendTyping, threadID)` but was often called with just `(threadID)`
  - When called with single parameter, `threadID` became `undefined` causing `.toString()` to fail
  - Added intelligent parameter detection to support both calling patterns:
    - `api.sendTypingIndicator(threadID)` - Shows typing indicator (default true)
    - `api.sendTypingIndicator(true/false, threadID)` - Controls typing indicator
  
- **Improved**: Parameter validation and error handling
  - Added validation to ensure threadID is always provided
  - Added try-catch wrapper for better error handling
  - Function now throws descriptive error when threadID is missing
  - Callback errors are properly handled in both success and failure cases

### Technical Details

**What Was Broken in v3.7.0:**
```javascript
// Strict parameter order - failed when called with just threadID
return async function sendTypingIndicatorV2(sendTyping, threadID, callback) {
    thread_key: threadID.toString(), // ❌ Crashes when threadID is undefined
}
```

**What's Fixed in v3.7.1:**
```javascript
// Flexible parameter detection
if (typeof sendTyping === 'string' || typeof sendTyping === 'number') {
    // Called with just threadID: sendTypingIndicator(threadID)
    actualThreadID = sendTyping;
    actualSendTyping = true; // Default to showing typing
} else {
    // Called with both: sendTypingIndicator(boolean, threadID)
    actualSendTyping = sendTyping;
    actualThreadID = threadID;
}

// Validate before use
if (!actualThreadID) {
    throw new Error('sendTypingIndicator: threadID is required');
}
```

### Migration Guide

**No breaking changes!** The fix is backward compatible.

**Both patterns now work:**
```javascript
// Old way (still works)
await api.sendTypingIndicator(true, threadID);

// New way (now also works)
await api.sendTypingIndicator(threadID); // Shows typing indicator
```

### Impact
- ✅ Fixes AI-generated commands that use simplified typing indicator syntax
- ✅ Maintains backward compatibility with existing code
- ✅ Better error messages for debugging
- ✅ More developer-friendly API

## [3.6.9] - 2025-11-01

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

This release fixes a critical logout error that prevented proper cleanup when removing or restarting bots.

### Fixed

- **Critical**: `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading '1')` in logout function
  - Root cause: Missing null/undefined checks when accessing Facebook's logout markup response
  - The `.find()` method was returning `undefined` when the markup element wasn't found
  - Accessing `[1]` on `undefined` caused the application to crash
  
- **Critical**: Bots continuing to respond to messages after deletion
  - Root cause: MQTT connection remained active even after logout was called
  - Messages were still being received and processed by deleted bots
  - Added MQTT client disconnection before logout process
  
- **Improved**: Graceful logout handling
  - Added comprehensive null/undefined checks for all response properties
  - Added early returns when session is already logged out
  - Added validation for context and jar objects before attempting logout
  - **MQTT client is now forcefully disconnected before logout**
  - Logout now marks session as logged out even if errors occur (prevents stuck sessions)
  - Added multiple safety checks in event handlers to prevent processing after deletion

### Technical Details

**What Was Broken in v3.6.8:**
```javascript
// No null checking - crashed if element wasn't found
const html = resData.jsmods.markup.find(v => v[0] === elem.markup.__m)[1].__html;

// MQTT connection remained active after logout
// Deleted bots continued receiving and processing messages
```

**What's Fixed in v3.6.9:**
```javascript
// 1. Disconnect MQTT first to stop all incoming messages
if (ctx.mqttClient) {
  ctx.mqttClient.end(true); // Force close
  ctx.mqttClient = null;
}

// 2. Proper null checking with early returns
const markupElement = resData.jsmods.markup ? 
  resData.jsmods.markup.find(v => v && v[0] === elem.markup.__m) : null;

if (!markupElement || !markupElement[1] || !markupElement[1].__html) {
  utils.log("logout", "Could not find logout markup. Session may already be logged out.");
  ctx.loggedIn = false;
  return;
}

const html = markupElement[1].__html;

// 3. Additional safety checks in event handlers
const currentBot = this.bots.get(botId);
if (!currentBot || currentBot.status === 'offline' || !currentBot.api) {
  return; // Ignore events from deleted bots
}
```

### Impact

- Bot restart now works properly without crashes or double responses
- Bot deletion completes successfully without errors
- **Deleted bots immediately stop responding to messages**
- **MQTT connections are properly closed, preventing ghost responses**
- Sessions are properly cleaned up even when logout fails
- No more unhandled rejection errors during bot management
- Event handlers ignore messages from removed bots

### Benefits

- ✅ **Graceful error handling** - No more crashes during logout
- ✅ **Better cleanup** - Sessions always marked as logged out
- ✅ **MQTT disconnection** - Connections properly closed, no ghost responses
- ✅ **Improved logging** - Clear messages when session already logged out
- ✅ **Robust bot management** - Restart and delete operations work reliably
- ✅ **Event filtering** - Deleted bots' events are ignored immediately

### Migration Notes

No code changes required - this is a drop-in bug fix for v3.6.8.

If you're experiencing logout errors, update immediately:

```bash
npm install biar-fca@3.6.9
# or
npm install biar-fca@latest
```

## [3.6.7] - 2025-10-31

### 🐛 Critical Bug Fix

This release fixes a critical bug introduced in v3.6.6 that prevented the bot from starting.

### Fixed

- **Critical**: `cookieRefreshManager.start is not a function` error
  - Root cause: CookieRefreshManager class was corrupted during code merge in v3.6.6
  - Constructor was missing proper initialization of counter variables
  - `start()` method was misplaced and mixed with PatternDiffuser class code
  - Fixed class structure with proper constructor and method separation

- **Critical**: `attempt NaN` in cookie refresh logs
  - Root cause: `refreshCount`, `mqttPingCount`, `failureCount`, and `mqttPingFailures` were not initialized
  - Added all counter variables to constructor initialization
  - Now properly tracks refresh attempts and failures

- **Critical**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'split')`
  - Root cause: Undefined variables causing errors in refresh cycle
  - Fixed by ensuring all variables are initialized in constructor

### Technical Details

**What Was Broken in v3.6.6:**
```javascript
// Constructor was trying to auto-start (wrong)
constructor(ctx, defaultFuncs, globalOptions) {
    this.ctx = ctx;
    // Missing: this.refreshCount = 0;
    // Missing: this.mqttPingCount = 0;
    // Missing: this.failureCount = 0;
    // Missing: this.mqttPingFailures = 0;
    
    // Auto-starting timers in constructor (wrong)
    this.refreshTimer = setInterval(...);
    this.startMqttKeepAlive();
}
```

**What's Fixed in v3.6.7:**
```javascript
// Proper initialization
constructor(ctx, defaultFuncs, globalOptions) {
    this.ctx = ctx;
    this.defaultFuncs = defaultFuncs;
    this.globalOptions = globalOptions;
    this.refreshInterval = 1200000;
    this.mqttPingInterval = 30000;
    this.isRefreshing = false;
    this.refreshTimer = null;
    this.mqttPingTimer = null;
    this.lastRefresh = Date.now();
    this.lastMqttPing = Date.now();
    this.refreshCount = 0;          // ✅ Now initialized
    this.mqttPingCount = 0;         // ✅ Now initialized
    this.failureCount = 0;          // ✅ Now initialized
    this.mqttPingFailures = 0;      // ✅ Now initialized
}

// Separate start method (correct)
start() {
    if (this.refreshTimer) return;
    
    utils.log("🔄 Cookie Refresh Manager: STARTED");
    // ... setup timers
}
```

### Impact

- v3.6.6 was **completely broken** - bot couldn't start at all
- v3.6.7 **restores full functionality** of the keep-alive system
- All features from v3.6.6 now work as intended:
  - ✅ Cookie refresh every 20 minutes
  - ✅ MQTT keep-alive pings every 30 seconds
  - ✅ Comprehensive statistics tracking
  - ✅ Automatic failure recovery

### Migration from v3.6.6

If you're on v3.6.6, **update immediately** to v3.6.7:

```bash
npm install biar-fca@3.6.7
# or
npm install biar-fca@latest
```

No code changes required - this is a drop-in fix for v3.6.6.

### Recommendation

- ⚠️ **Do not use v3.6.6** - it has critical startup errors
- ✅ **Use v3.6.7** - all issues fixed, stable and tested

## [3.6.6] - 2025-10-31

### 🎉 Major Keep-Alive System Overhaul

This release completely fixes the keep-alive issue that was preventing bots from staying online for extended periods. The bot will now maintain a stable connection indefinitely!

### ✨ Added

- **MQTT Keep-Alive Pings** - Active MQTT presence pings every 30 seconds to maintain WebSocket connection
  - Sends presence updates through `/orca_presence` topic
  - Automatically starts 5 seconds after initialization
  - Smart logging (only every 10th ping = every 5 minutes)
  - Comprehensive failure tracking and reporting
  
- **Enhanced Statistics** - Extended `getCookieRefreshStats()` with MQTT keep-alive metrics
  - `mqttKeepAlive.enabled` - Whether MQTT pings are active
  - `mqttKeepAlive.pingCount` - Total number of pings sent
  - `mqttKeepAlive.pingFailures` - Number of failed pings
  - `mqttKeepAlive.lastPing` - Timestamp of last successful ping
  - `mqttKeepAlive.timeSinceLastPing` - Milliseconds since last ping
  - `mqttKeepAlive.pingInterval` - Ping interval (30000ms)

- **Improved Logging** - Better visibility into keep-alive system status
  - Shows both cookie refresh and MQTT keep-alive intervals at startup
  - Displays timing for first cookie refresh (30s) and first MQTT ping (5s)
  - Uptime tracking in MQTT ping logs

### 🔧 Changed

- **MQTT Configuration Improvements**
  - Increased `KEEPALIVE_INTERVAL` from 10s to 60s for better stability
  - Increased `RECONNECT_PERIOD` from 1s to 3s for more stable reconnections
  - Extended `MIN_RECONNECT_TIME` from 26min to 2 hours
  - Extended `MAX_RECONNECT_TIME` from 1 hour to 4 hours
  - These changes reduce unnecessary reconnections while maintaining reliability

- **Enhanced Reconnection Scheduler**
  - Better time formatting (shows hours + minutes instead of just minutes)
  - More user-friendly display of reconnection intervals

- **Dual Keep-Alive Strategy**
  - Cookie refresh every 20 minutes (HTTP layer)
  - MQTT presence pings every 30 seconds (WebSocket layer)
  - Both work together to ensure maximum uptime

### 🐛 Fixed

- **Critical**: Bot not staying online after many hours
  - Root cause: Cookie refresh alone wasn't keeping MQTT WebSocket connection alive
  - Solution: Added active MQTT keep-alive pings to maintain connection
  
- **Critical**: MQTT connection dropping due to inactivity
  - Root cause: No active pings being sent through MQTT connection
  - Solution: Regular presence updates keep the WebSocket connection active

- **Issue**: Too frequent MQTT reconnections (26-60 minutes)
  - Fixed: Extended to 2-4 hours with active keep-alive preventing need for reconnection

### 📊 Technical Details

**How the Keep-Alive System Works:**

1. **Cookie Refresh (HTTP Layer)** - Every 20 minutes
   - Refreshes authentication cookies from Facebook servers
   - Updates DTSG tokens for valid authentication
   - Rotates through 4 different endpoints for anti-detection
   - Prevents session expiration

2. **MQTT Keep-Alive (WebSocket Layer)** - Every 30 seconds
   - Sends presence updates through MQTT connection
   - Keeps WebSocket connection active and prevents timeout
   - Monitors connection health with failure tracking
   - Automatically recovers from temporary failures

3. **Scheduled Reconnection** - Every 2-4 hours
   - Generates fresh client ID
   - Re-establishes connection with new session
   - Provides additional layer of connection health maintenance

**Why This Works:**

- HTTP cookie refresh maintains authentication validity
- MQTT pings maintain WebSocket connection activity
- Both systems work independently but complement each other
- Comprehensive failure detection and automatic recovery
- Smart logging prevents log spam while providing visibility

### 💡 Migration Notes

No breaking changes - existing code will automatically benefit from these improvements!

The keep-alive system is enabled by default when you use:

```js
login(credentials, {
  cookieRefresh: true, // Default: true
}, (err, api) => {
  // Your bot will now stay online indefinitely! 🎉
});
```

### 🔍 New API Usage

```js
// Get comprehensive keep-alive statistics
const stats = api.getCookieRefreshStats();
console.log(stats);
// {
//   enabled: true,
//   refreshCount: 12,
//   failureCount: 0,
//   lastRefresh: "2025-10-31T12:34:56.789Z",
//   timeSinceLastRefresh: 234567,
//   refreshInterval: 1200000,
//   mqttKeepAlive: {
//     enabled: true,
//     pingCount: 240,
//     pingFailures: 0,
//     lastPing: "2025-10-31T12:34:55.123Z",
//     timeSinceLastPing: 1234,
//     pingInterval: 30000
//   }
// }
```
